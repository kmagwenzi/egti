/* ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ */
/* 
   This file implements the "Grey-Out" technique to create visual depth and focus.
   
   PRINCIPLE:
   - Inactive/Background areas are "muted" (desaturated, slightly darkened).
   - Active/Content areas are "vibrant" (full saturation, high contrast).
   
   RESULT:
   - Guided user attention (Hierarchy: 1. Hero, 2. Content, 3. Background).
   - "Pop" effect for cards and key information.
   - Reduction of visual noise from decorative elements.
*/

/* 
   1. BACKGROUND MUTING
   Reduces the saturation and brightness of background sections.
   This pushes them "back" visually, allowing content to sit "forward".
*/
.bg-muted {
  filter: saturate(0.6) brightness(0.95) contrast(0.92);
  transition: filter 0.3s ease;
}

/* 
   2. CONTENT VIBRANCY RESET
   Crucial: Child elements inherit filters from parents. 
   We must reset the filter on content containers so text/cards remain sharp.
*/
.content-vibrant {
  filter: none; /* Resets the parent .bg-muted filter */
}

/* 
   3. DECORATIVE ELEMENT TAMING (Specific for Apply Today section)
   Decorative stripes often compete with text. We drastically reduce their presence.
*/
.decorative-muted {
  opacity: 0.15; /* Heavy reduction from 1.0 */
  filter: saturate(0.3); /* Remove most color */
}

/* 
   4. BACKGROUND IMAGE SOFTENING
   Background images can make text hard to read. We soften them.
*/
.image-muted {
  opacity: 0.3;
  filter: grayscale(0.8) blur(3px); /* Soft focus effect */
}
